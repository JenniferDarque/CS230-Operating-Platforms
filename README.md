•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client for the specified software requirements was "The Gaming Room", a company that wished to transform their existing Android-based game called "Draw It or Lose It" into a multi-platform, web-based game. They wanted to improve the user experience while ensuring high-performance ability to handle large traffic due to the game's popularity. Key software requirements included the ability for multiple teams to participate, each with multiple players, unique game and team names, and the assurance that only one instance of the game would exist in memory at any given time using unique identifiers. 
•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I felt that the document did particularly well with 
•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Work on the design documents provide significant insights before the coding begins. It helps identify potential problems early on, defines requirements, and allows for consideration of the best technological solutions and architectural before any coding takes place.
•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could go back and revise any part of the document, it would probably be the domain model. I don’t feel as though the explanation was quite as clear as it could have been for a clear understanding of the diagram.
•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

In identifying user needs, the document makes clear that a transition from an Android-based game to a web-based multi-platform game is needed, so the software must be compatible with multiple types of operating systems and browsers. User experience is critical in software design because the success or failure is determined by users. 
•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

A similar software application design approach would involve understanding the client's needs, translating them into technical requirements, designing the software with the  requirements needed, and planning for any constraints. The same process that was used to analyze and design "Draw It or Lose It" multi-platform would be a good approach to follow in the future.
